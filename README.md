# bls-example

Example code to show (and test) BLS data access

## Status

Getting the basics for local running going

- [x] `servicex-local` can't run on a local file yet.
- New `func_adl_servicex_xaodr22` that is released seems to work for this BLS stuff!!

## Usage

1. You'll need an environment with jupyter to run the code, see `requirements.txt` for everything you need.
